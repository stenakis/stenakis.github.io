          <p>
            Rainmeter skins are shared on DeviantArt under the alias “OffBalance
            Creative Team.” DeviantArt is a key platform for digital and
            handmade art, and it's where most Rainmeter skins are found. While
            made individually, they’re shaped by others’ work—through design,
            features, or shared code while Rainmeter’s open-source nature allows
            creators to build upon one another.

            The settings menu is the best example of a good user experience in
            every application. In clockworld, it enables the customization of
            the skin in various ways, split into categories. it manages to
            display a big amount of information organized in a very convenient
            way. Just like that, clockworld settings menu features consistency
            along with sleek and user friendly environment despite rainmeter’s
            restrictions. By using packages created by the community and with
            the advice of its people, this interface came to life and it’s
            praised as one of he best Rainmeter settings menus out there.

      <h2>Design Language</h2>
      <p>
        The Settings menu is heavily inspired by he windows 10 Fluent design
        system which was a successful story when it came out. The design is
        simple and is focused on usability without compromising on design
        familiarity, creating a user friendly design. The view window is split
        into two parts, the settings categories and the settings options. Its
        way of usage is really simple as users are already accustomed with this
        type of design from their operating system. First, the categories are
        easily recognizable by the corresponding icon in front of the text for
        fast reading. The wallpaper color, described before, works as the main
        (accent) color declaring which category is selected. After navigating to
        one, users can access the Settings on the right side of the window.
        There, depending on the type, can users interact with all kinds of
        interface elements such as buttons, text fields and toggles, Each one of
        them follows common design rules as follows: <br />
        <br />
        Action buttons: Filled with a light black color with rounded corners.
        Provide some kind of action when clicked.
        <br />
        Text boxes: Outlined boxes with the accent color as border. Enables
        clicking for entering information. <br />
        Toggles: Colored with the accent color when turned on, outlined with
        white when turned off.
        <br />
        <br />
        Every skin has very similar style of Settings menu. This is done in
        order to effectively manage adaptability and scalability for the long
        term. Despite that, every skin has its own special settings and thus the
        Settings changes its content but with keeping the overall design
        parameters the same.

      <h2>Feature: Automatic Updates</h2>
      <div style="height: 10px"></div>
      <div class="row g-4">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <div
            style="background-color: var(--background_light); padding: 30px"
            class="rounded-4"
          >
            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>
              Users have to check for skin updates manually every couple days or
              weeks, missing out on potential new features.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <div
            style="background-color: var(--background_light); padding: 30px"
            class="rounded-4"
          >
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>
              Every skin is equipped with an update check system, where users
              can check if there is an available update and download it through
              the integrated skin installer just by pressing the Download button
              in the skin’s Settings menu.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="gap-40"></div>
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        To enable automatic updates, I stored new files in an online
        database—GitHub—since it manages version history and supports open
        source projects. I created a PowerShell script that downloads the GitHub
        repository as a .zip, extracts it, and replaces the old files in
        Rainmeter’s skin folder. An update checker in the settings compares the
        current skin version (from a local file) with the latest version (from
        an online file). If they differ, an update is available. When the “Check
        for updates” button is pressed, both versions are read, stripped of
        dots, converted to integers, and compared. This simple system was part
        of a broader exploration of Rainmeter’s features and scripting with
        languages like Lua.
      </p>
      <div class="gap-40"></div>
      <h2>The Future</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of this feature for the future is to create fully automatic
        updates that happen when users open their computer. This will make the
        user experience even more seamless, removing the need to check for
        updates manually. Due to some limitations of Rainmeter, progress is slow
        as I continue researching other ways to integrate this feature. <br />
        <br />
        Another possible idea is to create a skin distribution platform (like
        the Google Play Store) where developers can upload their skins and be
        eligible for OTA updates. There has been a test in the past creating a
        platform like this, but it didn’t move forward due to its workload and
        platform limitations. Currently, I don’t have the appropriate knowledge
        to work around those challenges.
