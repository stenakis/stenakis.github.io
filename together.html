              ><br />Organizing a meetup through chat can become very tedious
              when everyone proposes their own thing. Some people don’t respond
              at all, some work and don’t show up at all. The group chat is
              flooded with questions and you scroll endlessly to find the one
              picture your friend took of you.

              see everything at a glance when organizing a meetup. Just propose
              and let everyone else express their opinion, within their own time
              frame.

      <h2>Influence: Social Media</h2>
      <div class="col-md-8">
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          Social networks have become an integral part of the daily lives of a
          large population of people around the world. But not everyone belongs
          to the same category. According to the Pew Research Center, users over
          the age of 30 prefer to use Facebook and YouTube more than Snapchat
          and Tiktok which seems to appeal to younger generations. Accordingly,
          the use of social networks decreases as people age. In the United
          States of America, 84% of young people aged 18-29 say they use social
          networks on a daily basis, while only 45% of people over 65 seem to do
          the same. <i>(Atske, 2021)</i>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          According to this data, some conclusions can be drawn regarding the
          general character of social networks and what needs they cover. Some
          social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter, were launched during
          the first years of public availability of the Internet. Consequently,
          the rules, both functional and design, have adapted to the times and
          the available technology. Initially, they were aimed at a young
          audience with few tools and customisation options while trying to
          become known and enter the everyday life of the average user by
          creating a new habit. However, as technology evolved, new platforms
          emerged, taking advantage of new technologies. To compensate for its
          share of the global market, Facebook introduced more and more features
          too often, leading to the phenomenon of Social Media Fatigue. Users,
          overwhelmed by a very high pressure, started to get tired and sought
          new simpler platforms such as Snapchat <i>(Bright et al., 2015)</i>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          But why were these platforms left behind? The key elements they
          focused on were few but clear and new-to-market tools and a simple
          user experience. Companies understood that young and relaxed users
          bring in much more revenue than existing users, so they started to
          create new platforms that were clearly targeting new generations.
          Fresh colours, soft movements and interesting typography were the main
          means of attracting the interest of the new generations. In addition,
          they started to follow the laws of user experience, rules that set the
          basis for the maximum user experience of an application. Nowadays,
          creating an application was not just in the hands of one or a group of
          developers but needed a special new approach related to the user's
          satisfaction while using the application. <i>(Frier, 2021)</i>

        <div class="col-md-8">
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            The character of the promotion of an application is influenced both
            by the target audience and the design choices of its identity. In
            Together, as the target is a young audience, the use of humor and
            directness is chosen in order to express a freer spirit which also
            follows the brand identity of the product. The content of the
            promotional applications initially describes in a few words a
            problem which, depending on the medium, may be accompanied by a
            complementary image. The solution is then proposed through a
            function of the application and finally the viewer is invited to
            install the application, as the final purpose of the promotion. In
            general, the advertising of the app is largely aimed at raising the
            emotional awareness of the viewers, a successful practice often used
            in the world of promotion.

          <h2>Typography</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            The rules of typography change in relation to the digital
            application as the promotional media are governed by different
            operational rules and have a different end goal. In promotion, the
            information hierarchy wishes to communicate a problem and then
            propose a solution in that order while intensifying the user's
            attention so that the promotional medium is both perceived and
            understood.

          <div class="gap-40"></div>
          <h2>Color</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            In promotional applications, colour has a strong role in terms of
            aesthetics and attractiveness. attractiveness. As in the digital
            application, the combination of dark tones with yellow gives a
            intensity through contrast and attracts the viewer's eye. Finally,
            the colour palette remains simple since it is complemented by the
            image element creating a complete aesthetic and colourful

        <div class="col-md-8">
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            The choice of promotion is related to the nature of the digital
            applications and the audience to which they are targeted audience.
            For this reason, specific choices have been made, such as the bus
            stop or the metro, places where young people are more likely to be
            moving around and other media such as magazine advertisements are
            not used. The use of other media such as magazine advertisements has
            not been used as young people are not familiar with these media. In
            addition, the character and content of the advertisements was
            adapted to each medium in order to the maximum readability and
            clarity of the information. Thus, in the subway advertisements, no
            space is allocated to the The advertisements in the metro ads did
            not use images, but only icons and a photo of a mobile phone in
            order to make it immediately accessible to the public. that the
            advertised product is a digital application. Images tend to create
            visual noise and to such an extent as in the case of the metro it
            was considered that it would be difficult to read of the other
            information in the advertisement
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Another approach was taken by online advertising. As the time a user
            spends looking at advertisements is minimal, the advertised product
            should be so clear that it can be recognized at first glance in a
            fraction of a second. Thus, in this case too, the use of images was
            not used, but rather the direct presentation of the application
            screens was preferred.

      <h2>The use of humour</h2>
      <div class="row g-5">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Humour is an integral part of Together’s advertising campaign and it
            is heavily based on its targeted age group. It is a fresh approach
            that really captivates the freedom and youthfulness that comes with
            the street language spoken by the young people and works as an
            effective means of getting closer to their needs and way of
            living.<br /><br />
            In the billboard example, the sign writes:” ‘I’ll be here in 5
            minutes’ - None ever even believed it“, which is a very common
            phrase when organizing a meetup. Using an annoying situation that
            happens very often as a problem, implies that the advertized
            product, in this case the app, can help deal with it or reverse it.
            Consequently, by utilizing a common oral everyday phrase, Together
            is able to communicate its purpose, without writing exactly how it
            helps, inviting the ad spectator to dive more into the product.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Together is a digital application that wants to solve a problem that
            is faced on a daily basis, the inability to organize meetings
            between friends. Through specific tools and validated design
            practices, it leaves nothing to chance but adapts its user
            experience according to its users and according to the laws of UX.
            All design elements have been used to maximize usability that will
            ultimately contribute to the success of the app. In addition, the
            design identity is completed through the promotional applications
            which aim to promote the application through the most appropriate
            ways and the most ideal means.
