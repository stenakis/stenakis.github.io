    <br>
    <div class="col-md-8">
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Social networks have become an integral part of the daily lives of a large
        population of people around the
        world. But not everyone belongs to the same category. According to the Pew Research Center, users over the age
        of 30 prefer to use Facebook and YouTube more than Snapchat and Tiktok which seems to appeal to younger
        generations. Accordingly, the use of social networks decreases as people age. In the United States of America,
        84% of young people aged 18-29 say they use social networks on a daily basis, while only 45% of people over 65
        seem to do the same. (Atske, 2021)</p>
      <br>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">According to this data, some conclusions can be drawn regarding the general
        character of social networks and
        what needs they cover. Some social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter, were launched during the first
        years
        of public availability of the Internet. Consequently, the rules, both functional and design, have adapted to
        the
        times and the available technology. Initially, they were aimed at a young audience with few tools and
        customisation options while trying to become known and enter the everyday life of the average user by creating
        a
        new habit. However, as technology evolved, new platforms emerged, taking advantage of new technologies. To
        compensate for its share of the global market, Facebook introduced more and more features too often, leading
        to
        the phenomenon of Social Media Fatigue. Users, overwhelmed by a very high pressure, started to get tired and
        sought new simpler platforms such as Snapchat (Bright et al., 2015)</p>
      <br>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">But why were these platforms left behind? The key elements they focused on were
        few but clear and new-to-market
        tools and a simple user experience. Companies understood that young and relaxed users bring in much more
        revenue
        than existing users, so they started to create new platforms that were clearly targeting new generations.
        Fresh
        colours, soft movements and interesting typography were the main means of attracting the interest of the new
        generations. In addition, they started to follow the laws of user experience, rules that set the basis for the
        maximum user experience of an application. Nowadays, creating an application was not just in the hands of one
        or
        a group of developers but needed a special new approach related to the user's satisfaction while using the
        application. (Frier, 2021)</p>
