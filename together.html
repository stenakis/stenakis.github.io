          <h4>The problem</h4>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Group chats can be chaotic. Organizing a meetup can become very
            tedious when everyone proposes their own thing. Some people don’t
            respond at all, some work and some decide to sleep for 5 hours in
            the afternoon. People don’t show up, group chat is flooded with
            questions and you scroll endlessly to find the one picture your
            friend took of you.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h4>The solution</h4>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Together is the visual interpretation of a group chat. Instead of
            long messages and constant scrolling, your friend group can now see
            everything at a glance when organizing a meetup. Just propose and
            let everyone else express their opinion, within their own time
            frame, no need to rush.
          </p>

      </div>
      <div class="padding-v"></div>
      <h4>Influence: Social Media</h4>
      <div class="col-md-8">
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          Social networks have become an integral part of the daily lives of a
          large population of people around the world. But not everyone belongs
          to the same category. According to the Pew Research Center, users over
          the age of 30 prefer to use Facebook and YouTube more than Snapchat
          and Tiktok which seems to appeal to younger generations. Accordingly,
          the use of social networks decreases as people age. In the United
          States of America, 84% of young people aged 18-29 say they use social
          networks on a daily basis, while only 45% of people over 65 seem to do
          the same. (Atske, 2021)
        </p>
        <br />
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          According to this data, some conclusions can be drawn regarding the
          general character of social networks and what needs they cover. Some
          social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter, were launched during
          the first years of public availability of the Internet. Consequently,
          the rules, both functional and design, have adapted to the times and
          the available technology. Initially, they were aimed at a young
          audience with few tools and customisation options while trying to
          become known and enter the everyday life of the average user by
          creating a new habit. However, as technology evolved, new platforms
          emerged, taking advantage of new technologies. To compensate for its
          share of the global market, Facebook introduced more and more features
          too often, leading to the phenomenon of Social Media Fatigue. Users,
          overwhelmed by a very high pressure, started to get tired and sought
          new simpler platforms such as Snapchat (Bright et al., 2015)
        </p>
        <br />
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          But why were these platforms left behind? The key elements they
          focused on were few but clear and new-to-market tools and a simple
          user experience. Companies understood that young and relaxed users
          bring in much more revenue than existing users, so they started to
          create new platforms that were clearly targeting new generations.
          Fresh colours, soft movements and interesting typography were the main
          means of attracting the interest of the new generations. In addition,
          they started to follow the laws of user experience, rules that set the
          basis for the maximum user experience of an application. Nowadays,
          creating an application was not just in the hands of one or a group of
          developers but needed a special new approach related to the user's
          satisfaction while using the application. (Frier, 2021)

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            This type of person is the life of the party. They will attend every
            meetup you create and will be the first to organize everything from
            a simple night out to a house party with dozens of guests. They want
            a way to organize their meetups as they are so many, they often lose
            track.

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            This type of person doesn’t go out that much, has a small friend
            group but makes every moment count. They value small gatherings and
            making memories. They need a place to inform their friends of their
            rare meetups and make sure they don’t forget.

            You usually find this person sleeping. It doesn’t matter if you call
            them, text them, show up at their house, they will always have an
            excuse to why they don’t answer. Their friends need a way to hang
            out with them, this type of person can get very funny and open once
            surrounded by people!
