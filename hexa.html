            My submission to the 2025 DesignFlows competition by Bending Spoons.
            With just 4 days to complete the challenge, I designed a
            mission-critical interface that enables seamless coordination
            between humans and special robots.

      <h3 class="title">THE BRIEF</h3>
      <p>
        Participants were presented with a scenario about designing a given user
        flow showing how a user navigated through the app to complete a specific
        task. The steps can be shortened into these bullet points:<br /><br />

        1. The user opens the app<br />
        2. The user checks the status of the Hexabots<br />
        3. The user monitor a Hexabot’s progress assigned with a task<br />
        4. The user receives updates on the status of the Hexabot
      </p>
      <div class="gap-80"></div>
      <h3 class="title">THE DATA</h3>
      <p>
        During the 4-day challenge, participants would not have enough time to
        collect and analyze the necessary personas in order to create user
        scenarios. Fortunately, the brief gave out all the information needed to
        have a complete picture of the app’s users personality along with their
        profiles, behavioral patterns and preferences, which really help speed
        up the design process.<br /><br />
        1. Real-time, easy-to-read status updates are crucial.<br />
        2. Fast task assignment process with proper guidance can significantly
        reduce user stress.<br />
        3. Accessible interface: Users operate in challenging physical
        conditions.<br />
        4. Voice-activated task assignment and status checks could improve
        usability.<br />
        5. Providing options for customization could increase engagement and
        usability.<br />
        6. Clearly highlighting task locations and potential overlaps can
        prevent confusion.
      </p>
      <div class="gap-80"></div>
      <h3 class="title">TIMELINE</h3>
      <p>
        Effective time management for project success was crucial. Hexa was
        created under time pressure, so every decision counted. <br /><br />
        <span class="subtitle"> Data Processing: 20% </span>
        Thorough look at the available data.<br />Extract every bit of useful
        information.<br />
        Analyzing the meaning behind every sentence while grasping the whole
        project direction.
        <br /><br />
        <span class="subtitle"> Results analysis: 40% </span>
        : This was the biggest and the most important step of the whole process.
        BendingSpoons wanted to see how designers think, analyze and finally
        take action fast and produce results based on their cognitive abilities.
        Also, this was the part where misinterpreting information would lead to
        design inexpediency if the creator did not fully interpreted the data
        the correct way. During this phase, I created conclusions based on the
        brief, categorizing information based on importance. I dug deeper into
        user personas in order to translate their wants and needs into design
        solutions that adapt to each case individually. Finally, I created a
        theoretical user flow indicating every necessary user interaction to
        reach the end goal and complete the brief’s user journey.
        <br /><br />
        <span class="subtitle"> Design: 30% </span>
        : After all the research, it was time to design. As the base was already
        set and deeply analyzed, the design process did not take a long time. I
        only had to connect the puzzle pieces from my own analysis visualizing
        the conclusions of the previous step. This step included the design of
        the Low Fidelity screens focusing solely on the user experience and
        navigation with no colors and placeholder text. It was the time to
        construct the base of the whole experience that would make or break the
        design.
        <br /><br />
        <span class="subtitle"> Refinement: 10% </span>
        : Finally, it was time for the High Fidelity screens. Colors, typography
        and icons work together to elevate the Low Fidelity design and actually
        bring it to life while it approaches the closest it can get before the
        final production, by the programmers. In this final step, I had to
        create the UI part: the color scheme, the typography and the icon
        library while making sure everything fits aesthetically.

      <h3 class="title">FEATURE: CODENAMES</h3>
      <h1>#AD4</h1>
      <p>
        An integral part of a successful user experience in Hexa is based on
        fast Hexabot recognition and customization. Instead of using an image,
        “Codenames” uses a 3 character sequence or “Unique ID” in order to
        identify each bot in the app and during service support.<br /><br />

        + Ensures differentiality between bots (same model - same look) | UX<br />
        + Fully customizabile & memorable names | UX<br />
        + No distracting elements (images) | UI

      <div class="gap-40"></div>
      <p>
        <span class="subtitle"> Colors </span><br />
        • Futuristic but not extraterrestrial and somewhere between green and
        blue, the accent color helps push out the important information while
        keeping a sleek aesthetic and neutrality. The use of gradient is in
        style again but in a more serious and toned down style. Here, it’s used
        to indicate progress; starting from a darker hue and ending into a
        lighter tone, it implies movement and duration and since time management
        is our most important asset in this product, it should also be clear
        inside the app.<br />
        <b class="subtitle">Dark Mode</b>
        <br />Blending in with the surroundings, dark mode follows the space’s
        dark tint in order to harmonize the user's eyes with the environment.<br />+
        Information pops out easier<br />+ Device battery consumption is
        lower.<br />+ User focuses on taking care the most important part of the
        colony, the almighty Hexabots.

      <div class="gap-40"></div>
      <p>
        <span class="subtitle"> Typography </span><br />
        The key to an effective typography is to be readable while offering some
        variety. That’s why Neue Regrade was the optimal choice combining easy
        to read glyphs suitable for all text types (title, text, button) with a
        subtle futuristic character in their design.

      <div class="gap-40"></div>
      <p>
        <span class="subtitle"> Iconography </span><br />
        Icons convey meanings without text, that’s why they have to be as exact
        as possible. An icon that misses its definition can be misinterpreted,
        leading to unwanted results. That’s why in Hexa, icons were selected
        based on familiarity, respecting the fast pace while using the app; easy
        to understand icons are effective in faster user navigation and
        satisfaction.

      <h3 class="title">Q&A</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="subtitle">
          Can you describe your experience of this small time frame? </span
        ><br />
        Four days was a really small time frame that made me value every second.
        Focusing on all the parts of the brief was crucial while figuring out
        the information hierarchy before everything else. I had to take
        decisions in a short amount of time while making sure everything looked
        and felt polished. I was anxious I wouldn’t have enough time to go
        through my whole analysis of the brief and my design would have gaps
        that the user could feel.<br /><br /><span class="subtitle">
          What would you do if you had more time? </span
        ><br />

        If I had more time, I would focus more on the actual user experience.
        Instead of taking so much time analyzing the brief, I would experiment
        more on how the user interacts with the interface and how the user
        scenario could become more fluent and aligned to the user’s persona. I
        feel like the navigation has some gaps and points where the user is not
        sure where to go next. So, having had more time, I would try to make a
        better use of the navigation experience and what parts of the brief are
        the most important for that.
        <br /><br /><span class="subtitle"> What are you the proudest of? </span
        ><br />

        Being my first ever participation in a UI/UX design competition with so
        many other honorable designers, I am proud that I even was a part of it.
        Having the jury go through my work, actually taking time to analyze
        every bit to see whether I would make it to top 40, made me very
        confident about my skills. Also, I am very fond of constructing such a
        interface is just four days! I really enjoying challenging myself for
        things I love and I would say I felt very relieved with the final
        results.
        <br /><br /><span class="subtitle"> Final thoughts? </span><br />
        Reflecting back on this project, I see myself really focused and excited
        on this idea. Creating interfaces that are above all easy to use is
        something I really enjoy doing. Also, the brief’s idea was something I
        would never think of and it really pushed through my imagination.
        Overall it was an exciting but stressful experience that challenged my
        analyzing and designing skills to another level.
