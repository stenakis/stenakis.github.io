              their wants and needs into design solutions that adapt to each
              case individually. Created a theoretical user flow indicating
              every necessary user interaction to reach the end goal and

              was the time to construct the base of the whole experience that

              the closest it can get before the final production, by the
              programmers. In this final step, I had to create the UI part: the
              color scheme, the typography and the icon library while making
              sure everything fits aesthetically.

      <h2 class="title">Colors</h2>
      <p>
        • Futuristic but not extraterrestrial and somewhere between green and
        blue, the accent color helps push out the important information while
        keeping a sleek aesthetic and neutrality. The use of gradient is in
        style again but in a more serious and toned down style. Here, it’s used
        to indicate progress; starting from a darker hue and ending into a
        lighter tone, it implies movement and duration and since time management
        is our most important asset in this product, it should also be clear
        inside the app.

      <h2 class="title">Typography</h2>
      <p>
        The key to an effective typography is to be readable while offering some
        variety. That’s why Neue Regrade was the optimal choice combining easy
        to read glyphs suitable for all text types (title, text, button) with a
        subtle futuristic character in their design.

      <div class="gap-60"></div>
      <h2 class="title">Iconography</h2>
      <p>
        Icons convey meanings without text, that’s why they have to be as exact
        as possible. An icon that misses its definition can be misinterpreted,
        leading to unwanted results. That’s why in Hexa, icons were selected
        based on familiarity, respecting the fast pace while using the app; easy
        to understand icons are effective in faster user navigation and
        satisfaction.

      <p>
        <span class="subtitle">
          Can you describe your experience of this small time frame? </span
        ><br />
        Four days was a really small time frame that made me value every second.
        Focusing on all the parts of the brief was crucial while figuring out
        the information hierarchy before everything else. I had to take
        decisions in a short amount of time while making sure everything looked
        and felt polished. I was anxious I wouldn’t have enough time to go
        through my whole analysis of the brief and my design would have gaps
        that the user could feel.<br /><br /><span class="subtitle">
          What would you do if you had more time? </span
        ><br />

        If I had more time, I would focus more on the actual user experience.
        Instead of taking so much time analyzing the brief, I would experiment
        more on how the user interacts with the interface and how the user
        scenario could become more fluent and aligned to the user’s persona. I
        feel like the navigation has some gaps and points where the user is not
        sure where to go next. So, having had more time, I would try to make a
        better use of the navigation experience and what parts of the brief are
        the most important for that.
        <br /><br /><span class="subtitle"> What are you the proudest of? </span
        ><br />

        Being my first ever participation in a UI/UX design competition with so
        many other honorable designers, I am proud that I even was a part of it.
        Having the jury go through my work, actually taking time to analyze
        every bit to see whether I would make it to top 40, made me very
        confident about my skills. Also, I am very fond of constructing such a
        interface is just four days! I really enjoying challenging myself for
        things I love and I would say I felt very relieved with the final
        results.
        <br /><br /><span class="subtitle"> Final thoughts? </span><br />
        Reflecting back on this project, I see myself really focused and excited
        on this idea. Creating interfaces that are above all easy to use is
        something I really enjoy doing. Also, the brief’s idea was something I
        would never think of and it really pushed through my imagination.
        Overall it was an exciting but stressful experience that challenged my
        analyzing and designing skills to another level.
