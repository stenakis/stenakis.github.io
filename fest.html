      <h2>Aegina in a (pistachio) nutshell</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify" class="col-md-8">
        Aegina Fistiki Fest is a lively annual celebration held on the Greek
        island of Aegina, dedicated to the island’s famous pistachios — known
        locally as "fistikia". Every September, the main port fill with colorful
        stalls selling everything from fresh and roasted pistachios to sweets,
        liqueurs, and artisan products made with it. Alongside the market, the
        festival features concerts, art exhibitions and traditional dance
        performances, creating a festive atmosphere that blends local culture,
        gastronomy, and island hospitality.

        As an Art Director, I was the one who pushed this project to the

        apo ton topo tou” which briefly translates to “Pistachio from its place
        of origin” - or “Because origin matters” as suggested by the client -
        really highlights the goal of the festival.

            <p>
              Existing Phase 10 helper apps offer only rudimentary features,
              lacking enhancements that elevate the overall gaming experience.
              These applications often suffer from cumbersome usability due to
              poorly designed user interfaces and subpar user experience models,
              resulting in frustration for users. As such, there exists a clear
              opportunity to develop a more sophisticated and user-friendly
              solution that not only aids players in mastering the game but also
              enhances their enjoyment and engagement.

            <h3 class="gradient-text">THE SOLUTION</h3>
            <p>
              The design approach prioritizes a fresh and visually appealing
              aesthetic, incorporating game-suiting colors to evoke a sense of
              immersion and engagement. By integrating original user-focused
              features, it aims to enhance the overall gameplay experience,
              fostering greater interactivity and addressing previously unmet
              user needs. Through this iterative approach, we strive to deliver
              a Phase 10 helper app that exceeds user expectations and sets a
              new standard for usability and enjoyment.

        <p style="text-align: justify">
          Phase 10 is a universally inclusive card game suitable for families
          and groups of friends, transcending age boundaries with its engaging
          gameplay. While appealing to a diverse demographic, the primary player
          base typically falls within the age range of 12 to 65 years. This
          demographic exhibits a propensity for critical thinking and strategic
          organization, attributes integral to success in the game. From a
          design perspective, this necessitates a user interface and navigation
          system that seamlessly accommodates players of all ages. Ensuring a
          universally accessible and enjoyable experience across this broad age
          spectrum is paramount to the game's design objectives.

          Because the market is still not saturated by this type of apps, there
          was still time to create a better product without sacrificing on
          features that have already been implemented by other creators. By
          examining the competitors, I was able to distinguish what the market
          needed as well as what could be improved from the existing products.
          Also, I could see their way of implementing different features and
          whether they were successful or not from the feedback they got, from
          Google Play reviews. In this way, a healthy competition is created
          where every product is benefited from its competitors and each creator
          tries to level up their product by trying to overcome problems and
          difficulties faced by the others.

            “Rooms” is a special feature which really captures the player’s
            needs, especially in Phase 10 where taking down points is a bit
            harder than other card games. It ensures that every player has
            control over their score and is not prone to mistakes while
            providing a fresh way of playing card games.

            <h3 class="gradient-text">THE PROBLEM</h3>
            <p>
              Every round’s objective is described by a small sentence showing
              which cards the player has to discard. The game’s official rules
              include a special card with small cards and numbers. While it is
              successful on print, it can often lead to interface clutter when
              it comes to digital applications. As humans tend scan, instead of
              reading, it was proven necessary to find a new way to show these
              objectives.

          <h3 class="gradient-text">AN EXTRA TAKEAWAY</h3>
          <p>
            In order to improve the overall user experience when using Rooms,
            players would first join a Room and then vote which mode they would
            like to play, instead of having a host which decides from the start,
            and has to re-create a room if the player’s choose another mode.<br />While
            in paper, this sounds a great idea, in reality it creates some major
            user experience issues. The app’s structure focuses on the different
            types of available game modes, each of them belonging to a specific
            group according to ts creation parameters (who created it, how long
            it will be available, mode familiarity etc.). In order for the
            players to select a mode after entering a Room, all modes would have
            to be unified into one page where the players would select their
            desired one. The problem rises in the unification model which would
            confuse users about each mode’s category. All modes would look the
            same and the users would find it extremely hard to find their
            desired mode.
