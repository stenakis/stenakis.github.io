          <h3 class="gradient-text">THE PROBLEM</h3>
          <p>Existing Phase 10 helper apps offer only rudimentary features, lacking enhancements that elevate the
            overall gaming experience. These applications often suffer from cumbersome usability due to poorly designed
            user interfaces and subpar user experience models, resulting in frustration for users. As such, there exists
            a clear opportunity to develop a more sophisticated and user-friendly solution that not only aids players in
            mastering the game but also enhances their enjoyment and engagement.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6 mb-4 mb-md-0">
        <div style="border:1px solid white; padding: 30px;">
          <h3 class="gradient-text">THE SOLUTION</h3>
          <p>The design approach prioritizes a fresh and visually appealing aesthetic, incorporating game-suiting colors
            to evoke a sense of immersion and engagement. By integrating original user-focused features, it aims to
            enhance the overall gameplay experience, fostering greater interactivity and addressing previously unmet
            user needs. Through this iterative approach, we strive to deliver a Phase 10 helper app that exceeds user
            expectations and sets a new standard for usability and enjoyment.</p>

    <div class="gap-60"></div>
    <h3 class="gradient-text">TARGET AUDIENCE</h3>
    <div class="col-md-8">
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Phase 10 is a universally inclusive card game suitable for families and groups of
        friends, transcending age
        boundaries with its engaging gameplay. While appealing to a diverse demographic, the primary player base
        typically
        falls within the age range of 12 to 65 years. This demographic exhibits a propensity for critical thinking and
        strategic organization, attributes integral to success in the game. From a design perspective, this necessitates
        a
        user interface and navigation system that seamlessly accommodates players of all ages. Ensuring a universally
        accessible and enjoyable experience across this broad age spectrum is paramount to the game's design objectives.

    <div class="gap-40"></div>
    <div class="col-md-8">
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Because the market is still not saturated by this type of apps, there was still
        time
        to create a better product without sacrificing on features that have already been implemented by other creators.
        By examining the competitors, I was able to distinguish what the market needed as well as what could be improved
        from the existing products. Also, I could see their way of implementing different features and whether they were
        successful or not from the feedback they got, from Google Play reviews. In this way, a healthy competition is
        created where every product is benefited from its competitors and each creator tries to level up their product
        by
        trying to overcome problems and difficulties faced by the others.</p>

        <h3  class="gradient-text">AN EXTRA TAKEAWAY</h3>
        <p>In order to improve the overall user experience when using Rooms, players would first join a Room and then
          vote which mode they would like to play, instead of having a host which decides from the start, and has to
          re-create a room if the player’s choose another mode.<br>While in paper, this sounds a great idea, in reality it
          creates some major user experience issues. The app’s structure focuses on the different types of available
          game modes, each of them belonging to a specific group according to ts creation parameters (who created it,
          how long it will be available, mode familiarity etc.). In order for the players to select a mode after
          entering a Room, all modes would have to be unified into one page where the players would select their desired
          one. The problem rises in the unification model which would confuse users about each mode’s category. All
          modes would look the same and the users would find it extremely hard to find their desired mode.</p>
